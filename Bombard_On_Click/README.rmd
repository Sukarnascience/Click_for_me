Bombard On Click Means:-
the python code is little bit slow so, here their is a code named:- Click0.....to.......Click9.py
run all code together and you will get 15sec to setup eatch the code 
So, do rapidly asign the position and minimise the script and the script will start running in 15sec
under 15sec setup other if you can't then you can go to line no X and change "time.sleep(10)" to more sec

Now you may think why all this dont stop automatically The No. of code we will put in while loop the speed will decrease cause its need to do more work 
so for reducing it just i have put the clicking method in loop

#Please Note:-
      none of them will stop automatically so you need to close all code forcefully
      in Windows:- CTRL+ALT+DEL
      in Mac:- Simultaneously press the "command," "option," and "escape" key
      in Lunix:- Sorry you need to search according to your lunix version

Warning:- 
  it will be difficult to turn off the task so, make your own way to stop running all script
